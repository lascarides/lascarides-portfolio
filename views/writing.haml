	I am the author of the 2012 book 
	%a{:href => "http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16585356W/Next-gen_library_redesign"}
		Next-Gen Library Redesign 
	from ALA TechSource.

	From the publisher's summary: "This concise guide will help you choose and implement the techniques and best practices used by today's forward-thinking libraries to create the best possible patron experiences. You’ll learn website clean-up strategies, how to incorporate social media into your site, how to create and offer interactive and collaborative subject guides, promote your librarians with public profiles, and use crowdsourcing to create a collection with user input. And, to make it easier, you’ll find easy-to-understand explanations for technology buzzwords and acronyms."

	You can
	%a{:href => "http://www.scribd.com/doc/91214742/Next-Gen-Library-Redesign"}

		one of my lists 
	was published in 
	%a{:href => "http://openlibrary.org/books/OL23109225M/Mountain_man_dance_moves"}
		Mountain Man Dance Moves: The McSweeney's Book Of Lists
	= '.' 
	Technically, 
	%em
		this
	was my first paid writing gig ever. I tried to get an Awesome Unicorn on the cover of the Next-Gen book as well, but the publishers weren't having any of it, for some reason.
