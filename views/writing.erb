<p>I am the author of the 2012 book <a href="http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16585356W/Next-gen_library_redesign">Next-Gen Library Redesign</a> from ALA TechSource.</p> 

<p>From the publisher's summary: "This concise guide will help you choose and implement the techniques and best practices used by today's forward-thinking libraries to create the best possible patron experiences. You’ll learn website clean-up strategies, how to incorporate social media into your site, how to create and offer interactive and collaborative subject guides, promote your librarians with public profiles, and use crowdsourcing to create a collection with user input. And, to make it easier, you’ll find easy-to-understand explanations for technology buzzwords and acronyms."</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/91214742/Next-Gen-Library-Redesign">read a sample chapter</a> from the book on Scribd.</p>

<p>On a much sillier note, <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/tools-or-actions-in-photoshop-that-were-they-applicable-to-real-life-would-prove-useful-at-various-stages-of-a-relationship">one of my lists</a> was published in <a href="http://openlibrary.org/books/OL23109225M/Mountain_man_dance_moves">Mountain Man Dance Moves: The McSweeney's Book Of Lists</a>. Technically, <em>this</em> was my first paid writing gig ever. I tried to get an Awesome Unicorn on the cover of the Next-Gen book as well, but the publishers weren't having any of it, for some reason.</p>

<h3>Other Publications</h3>

<p><a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/2099">An overview of the development of Infomaki</a>, the in-house usability testing tool I created while at the New York Public Library, was published in Issue 8 of the Code4Lib Journal. The article also details how we used the tool to make decisions during a redesign of the NYPL website.</p>
